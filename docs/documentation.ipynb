    "# Tariffs and Trade Volume Analysis Project Documentation\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the relationship between trade tariffs and trade volume, with a specific focus on U.S. and China trade data. The analysis avoids political aspects and concentrates on the numerical impact of tariff changes on trade volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Date: 4/12/2025\n",
    "## What Has Been Accomplished\n",
    "### Project Planning\n",
    "- Created a comprehensive project outline defining data needs and access strategies\n",
    "- Established a clear notebook structure for the analysis\n",
    "- Identified key data sources (FRED, Census Bureau)\n",
    "- Determined specific FRED data series to use:\n",
    "    - Imports: IR14270\n",
    "    - Exports: IR14235\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Implementation (Initial Stage)\n",
    "- Set up development environment with necessary Python packages\n",
    "- Implemented proper environment variable management for API access\n",
    "- Created initial data retrieval code to fetch trade data from FRED\n",
    "- Configured the time range for analysis (2016-2025)\n",
    "- Set up basic data processing to combine export and import data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "- Prepared a detailed project overview explaining:\n",
    "    - Project introduction and purpose\n",
    "    - Dataset descriptions\n",
    "    - Analytical methods to be used\n",
    "    - Expected visualizations and findings\n",
    "    - Interpretation approach\n",
    "    - Summary format\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Needs To Be Done Next\n",
    "### Immediate Task: Debug RemoteDataError\n",
    "- **Issue**: API endpoints for FRED data series appear to be incorrect\n",
    "- **Action Required**:\n",
    "    - Verify the correct FRED series IDs for imports and exports\n",
    "    - Current IDs being used: IR14235 (exports) and IR14270 (imports)\n",
    "    - Check FRED documentation or web interface for accurate series IDs\n",
    "    - Test individual API calls before integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps After Debugging\n",
    "1. **Complete Data Collection**:\n",
    "    - Successfully retrieve trade volume data\n",
    "    - Create or scrape tariff timeline data (from Peterson Institute)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Processing**:\n",
    "    - Clean and align the collected datasets\n",
    "    - Handle missing values and normalize as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "    - Create time-series visualizations\n",
    "    - Apply statistical methods (correlation, regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**:\n",
    "    - Document findings and insights\n",
    "    - Generate final visualizations\n",
    "    - Prepare conclusions for presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optional Extensions**:\n",
    "    - Expand analysis to include sector-specific impacts\n",
    "    - Incorporate additional variables (e.g., currency fluctuations)\n",
    "\n",
