    "# Tariffs and Trade Volume Analysis Project Documentation\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the relationship between trade tariffs and trade volume, with a specific focus on U.S. and China trade data. The analysis avoids political aspects and concentrates on the numerical impact of tariff changes on trade volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Date: 4/12/2025\n",
    "## What Has Been Accomplished\n",
    "### Project Planning\n",
    "- Created a comprehensive project outline defining data needs and access strategies\n",
    "- Established a clear notebook structure for the analysis\n",
    "- Identified key data sources (FRED, Census Bureau)\n",
    "- Determined specific FRED data series to use:\n",
    "    - Imports: IR14270\n",
    "    - Exports: IR14235\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Implementation (Initial Stage)\n",
    "- Set up development environment with necessary Python packages\n",
    "- Implemented proper environment variable management for API access\n",
    "- Created initial data retrieval code to fetch trade data from FRED\n",
    "- Configured the time range for analysis (2016-2025)\n",
    "- Set up basic data processing to combine export and import data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "- Prepared a detailed project overview explaining:\n",
    "    - Project introduction and purpose\n",
    "    - Dataset descriptions\n",
    "    - Analytical methods to be used\n",
    "    - Expected visualizations and findings\n",
    "    - Interpretation approach\n",
    "    - Summary format\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Needs To Be Done Next\n",
    "### Immediate Task: Debug RemoteDataError\n",
    "- **Issue**: API endpoints for FRED data series appear to be incorrect\n",
    "- **Action Required**:\n",
    "    - Verify the correct FRED series IDs for imports and exports\n",
    "    - Current IDs being used: IR14235 (exports) and IR14270 (imports)\n",
    "    - Check FRED documentation or web interface for accurate series IDs\n",
    "    - Test individual API calls before integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps After Debugging\n",
    "1. **Complete Data Collection**:\n",
    "    - Successfully retrieve trade volume data\n",
    "    - Create or scrape tariff timeline data (from Peterson Institute)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Processing**:\n",
    "    - Clean and align the collected datasets\n",
    "    - Handle missing values and normalize as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analysis**:\n",
    "    - Perform exploratory data analysis\n",
    "    - Create time-series visualizations\n",
    "    - Apply statistical methods (correlation, regression)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**:\n",
    "    - Document findings and insights\n",
    "    - Generate final visualizations\n",
    "    - Prepare conclusions for presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optional Extensions**:\n",
    "    - Expand analysis to include sector-specific impacts\n",
    "    - Incorporate additional variables (e.g., currency fluctuations)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Web Scraping Evolution\n",
    "### 1. Initial Approach: Table Scraping\n",
    "The first iteration attempted to scrape tables from the Peterson Institute website. This approach failed because the website doesn't present the tariff timeline data in HTML table format.\n",
    "### 2. Second Approach: Direct DIV Scraping\n",
    "The next iteration targeted the DIV elements that contained the timeline data. However, this approach also failed because the webpage is built with JavaScript, and the initial HTML is merely a skeleton that gets populated dynamically after page load.\n",
    "### 3. Current Approach: Selenium-based Scraping\n",
    "The current implementation uses Selenium with headless Chrome to:\n",
    "1. Load the web page\n",
    "2. Allow JavaScript to execute and render the content\n",
    "3. Extract timeline data from the fully rendered DOM\n",
    "4. Process the data into a structured DataFrame\n"

    "## Current Challenges\n",
    "### Dependency Conflicts\n",
    "There are ongoing dependency conflicts with the current Selenium-based approach. You're exploring alternative solutions such as \"browser-use\" but encountering compatibility issues that need to be resolved.\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. Resolve the dependency conflicts in the current environment\n",
    "2. Evaluate alternative web scraping approaches that might be more robust\n",
    "3. Once data collection is stabilized, proceed with the analysis of tariff events vs trade volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing Pipeline\n",
    "The notebook combines the scraped tariff timeline with economic data to analyze potential correlations between trade policies and international trade volumes.\n"
