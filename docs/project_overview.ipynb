    "# Tariffs and Trade Volume: A Gentle Tug-of-War\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§­ Introduction\n",
    "Trade tariffs sound like political firestorms, but behind the scenes, they leave a clear data trail.\n",
    "This post skips the politics and dives straight into the numbers: what happens to trade volume when tariffs rise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ll look at the U.S. and China (because they make the data easy to grab), but the story applies globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“¦ The Dataset\n",
    "For this analysis, weâ€™ll use:\n",
    "- **Monthly U.S. import/export data** from the U.S. Census Bureau or FRED.\n",
    "- **Tariff rate estimates or policy change events** from public sources (like the Peterson Institute, USTR reports, or predefined change dates like 2018â€“2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll structure the data to align **tariff changes** with **trade volume shifts** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§® A Quick Look at the Math\n",
    "We'll use:\n",
    "- Time-series visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)\n",
    "- Smoothing techniques like rolling averages\n",
    "- **Correlation** (and optionally **lag correlation**) between tariff events and volume drops\n",
    "- Basic **OLS regression** (using `statsmodels`) to quantify relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "No machine learning today. Just clean, interpretable stats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“Š Visuals and Findings\n",
    "1. **Trade Volume vs Time** â€” Highlight key tariff events.\n",
    "2. **Imports/Exports Before and After Tariff Dates**\n",
    "3. **Regression Results** â€” Are tariffs really the culprit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weâ€™ll include code snippets, graphs, and maybe a few \"aha!\" moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ¤” Interpretation\n",
    "Here we discuss:\n",
    "- The strength (or weakness) of the relationship\n",
    "- Other factors that might influence trade (supply chain shocks, currency fluctuations, etc.)\n",
    "- The difference between **causation vs correlation** (brief but important)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§µ TL;DR Summary\n",
    "A brief bullet list of findings for the skimmers and the busy folks:\n",
    "- Trade dips often **align** with tariff spikes\n",
    "- Magnitude varies by sector\n",
    "- Butâ€¦ correlation isnâ€™t causation\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ§  Takeaway for Fintech/Data Nerds\n",
    "This is a great example of using:\n",
    "- Time-series data for **economic analysis**\n",
    "- Simple regression for quick insight\n",
    "- Data storytelling that doesnâ€™t need a neural net\n",
    "\n",
